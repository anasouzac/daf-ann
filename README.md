Empirical modeling of turbidity removal in a dissolved air flotation system using artificial neural networks.
This dataset represents the operation of a dissolved air flotation prototype located at the Chemical Systems Engineering Department, School of Chemical Engineering, University of Campinas, Campinas, São Paulo, Brazil.

Exogenous input data:
  - Raw water turbidity  (NTU)
  - Saturation pressure (bar)
  - Saturated water flow rate (L/min)

Output data (target):
  - Turbidity removal (%)
